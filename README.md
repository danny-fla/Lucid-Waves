## Site Objectives

Design and create a blog site to demonstrate an increasing understanding of the libraries and frameworks available to developers.

My three main objectives were:

- ### Develop an Engaging and Responsive User Interface

    The objective was to craft a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. Leveraging the power of Django and Bootstrap, the aim was to ensure readability and ease of navigation for all users.

- ### Implement Robust Backend Functionality

  Utilizing the capabilities of the backend framework, the project aimed to provide users with a seamless experience. Users, whether authenticated through all-auth or alternative methods, could explore posts, comments, and a gallery of images. Additionally, they were empowered to create, edit, and delete their own posts and gallery images.

- ### Utilize External Cloud Database for Data Storage

  To ensure efficient data management, ElephantSQL was employed as the external cloud database, specifically handling the PostgreSQL database for the project. This decision was made to enhance scalability and data accessibility.


By achieving these objectives, the project aimed to showcase an adept understanding of various libraries and frameworks available to developers, delivering a comprehensive and dynamic blog platform.
